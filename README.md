## Installation

The purpose of the web application is to promote mental wellness, mindfulness, and track your progress. I want this app to aid with emotional and cognitive regulation by learning the triggers that lead to reactive states and helping to assess which coping skills to apply in the sequence of events, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to help avoid undesired reactions. A key feature I have is my inputs from the survey show up on an admin page, so that I can take all of the answers and see how people are feeling based on age, race, and scale how people are feeling from 1-5; with 5 being all the time and 1 none of the time. The questions in the survey are from a K10 test (Kessler Psychological Distress scale) which gages people distress/anxiety. I built my app this way because not only will it help me figure out future features for the app, but I or future customers can analyze the data and see how my users are feeling from a monthly, quarterly, or yearly perspective. I chose journaling because it aids with Dialectical Behavior Therapy. DBT teaches clients four sets of behavioral skills: mindfulness; distress tolerance; interpersonal effectiveness; and emotion regulation. I want my web application to assist people to look for behaviors patterns and triggers that occur in their life through journaling.
